# About Fred Grott(GWS)

![GWS Logo](/art/gws_logo_longform,_final.png)

**describe Fred Grott dev/design processes and GWS**

I am a FreeLance Android UX Java Application Engineer Expert who focuses on both consumer and enterprise mobile applications. I believe in implementing an agile design and development environment breaking down the communication and heavy executive barriers through effective application of remote working, communication tools, and agile processes which results in a more user desire-able and friendly mobile application. At its core, my agile processes are composed of change, commitment, leadership, passion, and a company culture of  awesome missions.

One of those missions should be that mobile application empowers the mobile device
user to become the hero in their own lives so that they can accomplish more meaningful
tasks and bring more meaning to their lives. Another mission should be creating
interesting and impactful mobile applications separate from client mobile applications as if I do not push to create impactful mobile applications on my own than why
should you use my services for the same purpose?

I contribute to several open source projects, some of those projects are in the mobile technology space.

Obviously, with owning my own design and development firm I do not outsource my sales process to recruiters. To contact me for 1099 design and development services you can use my email address in my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/shareme).
