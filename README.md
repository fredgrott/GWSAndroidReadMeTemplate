##About Fred Grott and GrottWorkShop

**describe Fred Grott dev/design processes and GWS**

It has become somewhat the unique leading the innovations in that mobile native
application development has become an expert field with release of hundreds of apis
every year to figure out how to support and back-port on the android platform. I find
that obsessing about the UX android user experience and being an android device advocate puts me in an unique position.

I happen to be a computer language and math polyglot that enjoys coding and math and
is somewhat focused on the joy of developing and designing android applications. I enjoy organizing fragmented data-sets into an android application that transforms a particular mobile activity of the end user into something enjoyable.

That also means that I strive to obtain the maximum effective coding and design environment and have found that is not the corporate work environment but a 1099 remote-working consulting arrangement for funded start-ups. I have found that the best fit is when the start-up tech co-founder inquires if I would like to design and develop their android application.
