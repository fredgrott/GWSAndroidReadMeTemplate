# Implementation

**Sound bite to two audiences tech and non-tech about the implementation**

style is to talk in sound bites to both the non-tech and teach audiences.

# About Fred Grott(GWS)

![GWS Logo](/art/gws_logo_longform_final.png)

**describe Fred Grott dev/design processes and GWS**

I am a Freelance Android UX Java Application Engineer Expert who focuses on both consumer and enterprise mobile applications. I believe in implementing an agile design and development environment breaking down the communication and heavy executive barriers through effective application of remote working, communication tools, and agile processes which results in a more user desire-able and friendly mobile application. At its core, my agile processes are composed of change, commitment, leadership, passion, and a company culture of  awesome missions.

I excel at building consumer mobile application products because I am heavily involved in building mobile application products for my own start-up under the WeFit platform name. Given that I have to evolve the product from something that barely gets a
relationship with a mobile device user to something that the mobile user cannot live without would it not make sense to have that developer develop your start-up product than a development or design shop with no passion for start-up products(most developer and design shops do not make mobile application products for their own start-up)?

Obviously, with owning my own design and development firm I do not outsource my sales process to recruiters. To contact me for 1099 design and development services you can use my email address in my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/shareme).
