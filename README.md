**talk in sound bites to both tech and non-tech audiences, STORY FIRST than allegories, sentence fragments preferred sentences only 12 words long**

**description and purpose of project here**

I was reading someone dissect ad-copy of the Apple iPhone...

And it occurred to me that to reach the non-tech audiences I have to Converse Different..

Want the power that comes with more people reading your readme?

Fork, this repo and re-use my template..

**describe Fred Grott dev/design processes and GWS**

It has become somewhat the unique leading the innovations in that mobile native
application development has become an expert field with release of hundreds of apis
every year to figure out how to support and back-port on the android platform. I find
that obsessing about the UX android user experience and being an android device advocate puts me in an unique position.

Among all those firms that want an android developer to accept an iOS UX design bias
I am somewhat a unique Unicorn in that I use the time wrestled away from 2-3 hour
round-trip commutes to obsess about how to port that new api thing back to older
devices to get that UX-UI wow factor that android device users gravitate towards.
I am somewhat focused on rejecting the IT-Body-Shop way of developing software.
There is nothing more boring than an inflexible piece of software and software users
who hate using that software and entrenched stake-holders who are not accountable to the end users.

I know how to get the maximum amount of code and the maximum amount of working milestones and that is by controlling my environment in which I code.  That means
I reduce commuting time from 2-3 hours round-trip to almost zero and I reduce
time spent in meetings to almost zero and reduce communication access to only
involve a few stake-holders. Micor-managing does not exist in that if you have to micro-manage a developer than you have made the wrong choice in choosing a developer.

With that saved time I have develop some unique processes that integrate with the
Android Platform and Development Ecosystem so that I can obtain specific information
required to make android native java application development smoother.Some of those processes allow me to develop my own OEM-device bug databases that not only contain details of the device-specific bugs but also specific software development work-arounds that solve that particular bug-problem. There is a simple analtyic pattern involved. Examine the data and organize said data to determine what problems
are evident. And than come up with solutions that integrate will within the subsystems I am working in.

It's a different way of doing things than the usual government style way of developing. That Trillion-Dollar F-35 will never see service with the military.
All because some of the stake-holders choose to make something palatable to Congress
in terms of spending while ignoring the middle-level people stating that it was not
viable as a solution. In software development we call it the thermocline-of-truth.
I am a rebel in that I insist on having direct lines of communication to the one's
writing the software development check to prevent ignorance of the thermocline-of-truth as far as the progress of software development and what features are working and which features are not working.

If you are a tech co-founder of a Chicago start-up and need to find an android developer, you may want to give some consideration to what I have stated above as
I am picky about what software development situations that I want to be in despite
the hundreds-of-thousands-of-dollars involved. Obviously, if you are uncomfortable
with what I have stated above as what I ask for than I am not a fit  for your
immediate android native java application needs.

Usually, I request a subway-paid-meal meeting at my location to determine if I want to pick your software development gig opportunity as my next focus. The contract is usually dirt-simple in that an advance is given and succeeding payments are made on a weekly basis triggered by the weekly working milestones that you receive.
