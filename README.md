# About Fred Grott and GrottWorkShop

![GWS Logo](/art/gws_logo_longform_final.png)

**describe Fred Grott dev/design processes and GWS**

I call it GrottWorkShop because it takes value and art to create heroes in both
Start-Ups and Mobile Application end Users. It is a craft act in that each mobile
application is like no other mobile application. Every firm or Start-Up is unique, should not your mobile android application reflect the values and unique personality of your firm? I think it should.

I choose to make both start-ups and mobile application end-users heroes by getting
start-ups to accept change in their mobile android application work-flows and UIs
to get to that sweet-spot of hockey-stick-like downloads and MAUs growth. I pioneer
new agile approaches to get that sweet-spot of an application code infrastructure
that allows me to fast prototype new application work-flows and new UIs.

You can contact me at firstname dot lastname at gmail dot com.
