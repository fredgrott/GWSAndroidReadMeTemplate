##The Sales Process

The recruiter's job is to sell inventory they do not own to potential job seekers
but the actual buyer is the firm doing the hiring. In such a bone-head system the
sales process is not controlled by the one eventually commissioned to do the work.
On top of that there is no financial incentive for the recruiter to go out of their
way to dedicate themselves to selling you or me.

I find that in controlling the sales process that I am the best person to describe
and sell my particular set of skills and experience to that start-up that wants to
create an Android native java application.

##Economics

Let's explain recruiter economics. Okay, the agency that the recruiter works for gets 30% of the salary or project price each time a firm hires a candidate they have submitted to that firm. That automatically means that any temp contract is 30%
less than the market freelance rate for that particular project.

In the online market case, the rate actually may go higher to reach the actual
market freelance rate. But, the if I use such a service I have to pay close to
30% myself for using that online service.

In both cases I would be paying 30% for the privelage of not having control of the sales process.  Here is the interesting part. Can you think of one successful company where they out-source their sales process?  Me neither, I can better economic effects
by controlling my own sales process.

##Competence

Studies completed by the big names such as Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, etc have shown that the HR games of puzzles, reference checks, and picking  elite workers has no
bearing on predicting who can create and who cannot create.  And that applies to all professions that in which the work is to create something. It even applies to such things as marketing professionals.  

However, there is something that applies here that we have forgotten from the education profession.  The technical interviews have switched to a whiteboard interview as it gets the potential candidate to in speech form explain how to create something to solve a set of problems. And the non-technical interviews have switched to using a combination of a cover letter essay combined with a speech on the subject.

They do this because when we explain a subject to someone not as familiar with that
subject the competence shows through in ensuring that the person who does not understand that particular aspect of a subject comes away with a deeper understanding of that subject.

The recruiters are not hired for their tech skills and due to dynamic rapid changing of technology they really have no time to even make a basic dent into such material and have no time to read long essays.  Because those avenues are already blocked there is no way to convince a recruiter on who is competent and who is not.

Thus, part of my sales process is to ask questions about what Android native java application the start-up intends to create. And than I create an essay that explains the android coding and design problems I have solved that relate to the Android
native java application they intend to have someone create. And that particular essay becomes the background essay of that one-page spec that I often create.

And as part of my sales process in asking the start-up what android applicaiton they
intend to create I inform the start-up when I cannot create their application and solve their problems and suggest other professionals who can or suggest how to search for those professionals.

##Sourcing

It use to be that due to a lot of local conferences a recruiter could attend those
local conferences to often source both sides of the equation in the form of job seekers and firms seeking job seekers with certain skills.  But with advent of internet disrupting the advertising model the economics of conferences held locally has gotten smaller and the number of communities grouped by skills of the professionals has exploded and fragmented.

Thus, the best sourcer is not the recruiter but me as I have more contact with my
marketing targets, start-ups looking for remote android developers, than the actual
recruiter has at any one time. And due to my involvement in the android application
development communities I have a better understanding of what android developers are within the Greater Chicago area than the recruiter.


##Conclusion

Thus, that is why I do not use recruiters. If you are butt hurt that I do not use you and thus do not get a 30% fee than face the facts YOU ARE BEING DISRUPTED TOUGH EFFING SHIT.
