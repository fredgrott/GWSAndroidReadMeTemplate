# My Android Way As Opposed To Your Way

My android way as opposed to your way of creating an Android native java application
whose UX/UI wows android device users.

# LESS MASS

We first start with the concept of less mass. If it has less mass it takes less mass
to change direction. Your Way is have tons of meetings, a 50 to 100 page spec and a 25 page contract and must use all the processes you name and the kitchen sink too.  My Way is somewhat more lean:

A one page contract that commits both parties to a week at a time and a very small
one-time advance rather than big advances and long-term  commitments.

A one page spec

A commitment to pick the development and design processes that fit the mission in what is being created.

That lower mass needed to change direction means that as your firm or start-up becomes
more aware of what the consumer end user is expecting in your android native java application that I can actually change direction on a weekly basis. Is that not what you should pay for?

# I DO NOT DO INTERRUPTIONS

I do not do hours of meetings. I do not do 2-to-3 hour round-trip commutes to your office so that you can micro-manage me. My best coding happens in un-interrupted blocks of time and thus I find that I have to CHOOSE-TO-CONTROL-AND-DEMAND-AN-INTERRUPTION-FREE-CODING-ENVIRONMENT that working remotely(telecommuting) provides.

That also extends to some other things.

# I DO NOT DO RECRUTIER INTERRUPTIONS

I do not deal with recruiters.  Recruiters operate from this notion that they have to sell someone's else's inventory to get that one sale by interrupting everyone else.
That is not an effective hiring strategy for your firm or start-up and only benefits
the recruiting industry in the form of that 30% fee that you pay them. I assure you that taking that 30% fee and paying it out in the form of a bonus for the consumer
mobile native application being created on time and on budget is a more economically effective choice for your firm.

# I DO NOT DO PHONE INTERRUPTIONS

Technology is such a wonderful thing as I have this exceptional secretary that always
gives me what I want and when I want it in the form of such things as voice-mail with my GoogleVoice Number and my cellphone Number, email, etc. My automatic secretary even puts my email messages in priority boxes for me to review. Is that not the extremely cool! All so that I have these un-interrupted blocks of time to create new code and mobile applications.

# I DO ANDROID ONLY AND FIRST

There are a lot of IT-BODY-SHOPS out there that do all front-end development or
back-end development or both.  I prefer to continue to hone my expert android native java application design and development skills and give the best UX/UI experience to the android device end-users as it is more enjoyable.

There are a number of start-ups that have the idea that they can take their iphone
UX design form their designer and force it on me. I always refuse such requests as it
is not in the best interest of producing that android UX/UI wow that the android device user has come to expect from using all those wonderfully designed Google free android applications.

Fair warning, I regularly refuse to submit proposals to do the full frontend including two mobile platforms and mobile web and or back-ends on gun.io, toptall, etc and will do the same refusal for outside inquiries. I assure you that short-term saving of having one person create the native iOS application and the native java Android application will only over the long-term bite-you-in-the-ass.

# I DO NOT DO FULL AGILE

I do not do full agile but instead pick the development processes that happen to work in the situation at hand. Sometimes that is the full set of agile development processes and sometimes its only a few select agile processes.

Let me give you an example in mobile we still optimize the GUI code to get less
memory and faster GUI rendering so often unit-testing of that portion of the
mobile android application is held off until that optimization of GUI code is
completed.

And development and design processes are not these written-in-stone static things they change as technology and human-kind advance. Thus, the dynamic choose the processes that best fit the situation is somewhat effective.

# I DO CODE AND RELEASE DAILY

I do daily milestones as it is easy to do and really helps you break down large
problems into smaller manageable problems to solve. Even when I am experimenting I do daily milestones.

# I DO ORGANIZE AND ANALYZE DATA

In a past life I was training to become a Molecular Chemistry and Biology Scientist
and thus my core habits of organizing data and analyzing data are somewhat firmly
embedded in my daily habits. And it just so happens that organizing data and analyzing said data to integrate better with a mobile activity of an end user happens to produce
winning mobile applications.

# I DO HOLD SEE CODE DEVELOPMENT IN ACTION MEETINGS

The reason why I often request that the start-up come to my location and buy me a
subway meal is to present the opportunity for you the start-up to see my design and
development processes in action. Seeing the design and development processes I use
in action is the sort-of-thing that cannto be faked.

# CONCLUSION

I do not create android applications your way. I am sure that some person will decide
to take your money and do it your way but I cannot in good conscience take your money and create the native java Android application to be as dismal and disgusting of an android application as your way will produce.
